## What is Model Context Protocol?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard enabling AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge between AI models and your databases, APIs, or services.

## Core MCP Components

### MCP Server
A service that provides tools and data to AI clients. **Tablr MCP is an MCP server** that exposes database management capabilities to AI assistants.

### MCP Client  
An application that uses MCP servers to extend capabilities. Examples include Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and custom applications.

### Tools
Functions the server exposes for client use. Tablr MCP provides database management tools like `list_tables`, `query_records`, and `create_table`.

### Transport
How client and server communicate via stdio, HTTP, or WebSocket protocols.

## Why Use MCP?

- **Standardized Interface** - Works with any MCP-compatible AI assistant
- **Secure Access** - Controlled access to data with proper authentication  
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new capabilities as needs grow
- **Interoperable** - One server works with multiple AI clients simultaneously

## How MCP Works

1. **Connection** - AI client connects to MCP server
2. **Discovery** - Client discovers available tools and resources
3. **Execution** - When you ask AI to perform database operations, client calls appropriate tools
4. **Response** - Server processes requests, interacts with database, returns formatted results
