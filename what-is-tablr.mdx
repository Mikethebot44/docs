## Database Management Through AI

Tablr MCP is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for comprehensive PostgreSQL database management. It enables AI assistants to:

- **Explore** database structure (tables, schemas, relationships)
- **Query** data with complex filters and sorting
- **Modify** table structures and data
- **Execute** custom SQL safely
- **Manage** operations through natural language

Instead of manually writing SQL or using database tools, ask your AI assistant: *"Show me all users created this week"* or *"Create a new table for storing blog posts"*.

## Example Usage

Once configured, interact with your database through natural language:

```
You: "Show me all tables in my database"
AI: [Uses list_tables tool and displays results]

You: "Get the schema for the users table"  
AI: [Uses get_table_schema tool]

You: "Find all users created in the last week"
AI: [Uses query_records with date filters]

You: "Create a new table for storing blog posts"
AI: [Uses create_table with appropriate schema]
```

## Architecture

Tablr MCP acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your PostgreSQL database:

1. **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) sends requests
2. **Tablr MCP Server** processes and validates operations  
3. **PostgreSQL Database** executes database operations
4. **Results** are formatted and returned to the AI assistant
