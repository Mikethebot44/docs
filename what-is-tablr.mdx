## Vector Database Operations Through AI

Tablr MCP is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for semantic search and content indexing. It enables AI assistants to:

- **Index** repositories, documentation, and content sources
- **Search** using natural language queries that understand meaning
- **Discover** code examples and implementations through semantic similarity
- **Manage** vector indexes and monitor indexing progress
- **Analyze** indexed content through AI-powered operations

Instead of manually setting up search systems or keyword matching, ask your AI assistant: *"Find authentication examples in this codebase"* or *"Index the Next.js documentation for semantic search"*.

## Example Usage

Once configured, interact with indexed content through natural language:

```
You: "Index the React repository for semantic search"
AI: [Uses index_repository tool to process GitHub repo]

You: "Find authentication examples in my indexed repositories"  
AI: [Uses semantic_search tool with natural language query]

You: "Search for useEffect hook implementations"
AI: [Uses search_code tool with language filtering]

You: "What's the status of the documentation indexing?"
AI: [Uses check_index_status tool to show progress]
```

## Architecture

Tablr MCP acts as a bridge between AI assistants and vector database operations:

1. **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) sends requests
2. **Tablr MCP Server** processes and validates operations  
3. **Vector Database** executes semantic search and indexing operations
4. **Results** are formatted and returned to the AI assistant
