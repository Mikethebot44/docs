---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18.0.0\+** 
- **Supabase database**
- **MCP-compatible AI assistant** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Step 1: Install Tablr MCP

Install the Tablr MCP server globally:

```bash
npm install -g tablr-mcp
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory which you would like to use Tablr MCP with:

```env
PG_CONNECTION_STRING=your-postgres-connection-string

TABLR_API_KEY=your-tablr-api-key

SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your PostgreSQL Connection String

1. Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard
2. In the header, click 'Connect', it should bring up a dialog
3. You'll see three connection types: Direct connection, Transaction pooler, and Session pooler
4. Copy the 'Transaction pooler' connection string
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual Supabase project password. If you cannot remember your project password, navigate to Project Settings -\> Database -\> Database password to reset it
6. Add the PostgreSQL connection string to your `.env` file as `PG_CONNECTION_STRING`

## Step 3: Prepare Your Tablr API Key

1. Navigate to your Tablr Dashboard
2. In the sidebar, click 'API Keys'
3. Generate a new API key, adding a relevant title and description (optional)
4. Copy the API key and add it to `.env` as `TABLR_API KEY`

## Step 4: Prepare Your Supabase Variables

1. Navigate to your Supabase project Dashboard
2. In the sidebar, click 'Project Settings'
3. Navigate to the 'Data API' page
4. Copy your Supabase 'Project URL'
5. Add it to your `.env` file as `SUPABASE_URL`
6. Next, navigate to the 'API Keys' page
7. Copy the 'Service Role Secret'
8. Add it to your `.env` file as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

<Warning>
  IMPORTANT: Do not copy the Supabase Anon key, as it does not have the required permissions for use with Tablr MCP. Make sure you copy the Service Role Key
</Warning>

## Step 5: Configure Your AI Assistant

Configure Tablr MCP in your preferred IDE or editor:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Desktop">
    **1. Locate your configuration file:**
    - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

    **2. Add this configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "tablr": {
          "command": "tablr-mcp",
          "args": ["absolute/path/to/your/.env"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **3. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cursor">
    **1. Open Cursor settings:**
    - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
    - Type "Open Settings (JSON)" and select it

    **2. Add this configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "tablr": {
          "command": "tablr-mcp",
          "args": ["absolute/path/to/your/.env"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **3. Save and restart Cursor**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windsurf">
    **1. Open Windsurf and click the Plugins icon in the sidebar**

    **2. Go to "Manage plugins" â†’ "View raw config"**

    **3. Add this configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "tablr": {
          "command": "tablr-mcp",
          "args": ["absolute/path/to/your/.env"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **4. Save the file and refresh Windsurf**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="VS Code">
    **1. Install the MCP extension:**
    - Install "Copilot MCP" or "MCP Server Runner" from the VS Code marketplace

    **2. Open VS Code settings:**
    - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
    - Type "Open Settings (JSON)" and select it

    **3. Add this configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcp": {
        "servers": {
          "tablr": {
            "command": "tablr-mcp",
            "args": ["absolute/path/to/your/.env"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **4. Restart VS Code to apply changes**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Important**: 
- Replace `absolute/path/to/your/.env` with the actual absolute path to your `.env` file
- Do not use backslashes for Windows file paths - use forward slashes instead
- Example: `C:/Users/username/project/.env` not `C:\Users\username\project\.env`
</Note>

## Step 6: Start Using Tablr

Restart your AI assistant and start managing your database with natural language:

```
"Show me all tables in my database"
"What's the schema for the users table?"
"Find all users created in the last week"
"Execute this SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'"
```
## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Server Won't Start (red dot appears)">
    **Problem**: Red dot appears in MCP server configuration (server isn't starting correctly)

    **Solution**:
    This is a common issue, and there are multiple possible sources. Unfortunately there is no way to tell what your error is from the IDE:
    1. **The MCP configuration you used was not correct for your IDE (see step 5)**
    2. **The path to your .env file is incorrect**
     - Make sure it is the absolute path, not the relative path
     - Do not use backslashes for Windows
     - Verify your path is correct by right-clicking on the .env file and clicking 'Copy Path'
    3. **Environment Variables are incorrect**
     - Check that the Postgres Connection string you connected was the 'Transaction Pooler', not 'Direct Connection' or 'Session Pooler'
     - Make sure your Tablr API key is correct by checking in the Tablr dashboard API keys page
     - Re-check your Supabase URL and Service Role Key, and verify you are not using the Anon Key (important)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Other Checks">
    **Problem**: MCP server won't start

    **Solution**:

    - Verify Node.js version (18.0.0\+)
    - Check file paths in MCP configuration
    - Restart your AI assistant after configuration changes
