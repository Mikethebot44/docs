## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18.0.0\+** installed on your system
- **Supabase database**
- **MCP-compatible AI assistant** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Step 1: Install Tablr MCP

Install the Tablr MCP server globally:

```bash
npm install -g tablr-mcp
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory which you would like to use Tablr MCP with:

```env
PG_CONNECTION_STRING=
TABLR_API_KEY=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

## Step 2: Prepare Your PostgreSQL Connection String

1. Navigate to your Supabase project dashboard
2. In the header, click 'Connect', it should bring up a dialog
3. You'll see three connection types: Direct connection, Transaction pooler, and Session pooler
4. Copy the 'Transaction pooler' connection string
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual Supabase project password. If you cannot remember your project password, navigate to Project Settings -\> Database -\> Database password to reset it
6. Add the PostgreSQL connection string to your `.env` file as `PG_CONNECTION_STRING`

## Step 3: Prepare Your Tablr API Key

1. Navigate to your Tablr Dashboard
2. In the sidebar, click 'API Keys'
3. Generate a new API key, adding a relevant title and description (optional)
4. Copy the API key and add it to `.env` as `TABLR_API KEY`

## Step 4: Prepare Your Supabase Variables

1. Navigate to your Supabase project Dashboard
2. In the sidebar, click 'Project Settings'
3. Navigate to the 'Data API' page
4. Copy your Supabase 'Project URL'
5. Add it to your `.env` file as `SUPABASE_URL`
6. Next, navigate to the 'API Keys' page
7. Copy the 'Service Role Secret'
8. Add it to your `.env` file as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

<Warning>
  IMPORTANT: Do not copy the Supabase Anon key, as it does not have the required permissions for use with Tablr MCP. Make sure you copy the Service Role Key
</Warning>

## Step 5: Configure Your AI Assistant

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop/Cursor/Windsurf/VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tablr": {
      "command": "tablr-mcp",
      "args": ["absolute/path/to/your/.env"]
    }
  }
}
```

Note: do not use backslashes for windows file paths

## Step 6: Start Using Tablr

Restart your AI assistant and start managing your database with natural language:

### Basic Commands

```
"Show me all tables in my database"
"What's the schema for the users table?"
"Create a new table called 'posts' with title and content columns"
"Find all users created in the last week"
"Insert a new user with email john@example.com"
```

### Advanced Operations

```
"Add an index on the email column for better performance"
"Update all inactive users to set their status to archived"
"Execute this SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'"
"Create a backup of the important_data table"
```

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. **Test Connection**: Ask your AI assistant "List all tables"
2. **Test Operations**: Try creating a simple table or querying existing data

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Failed" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    **Problem**: "Authentication failed" or "Connection refused"

    **Solution**:

    - Verify your PostgreSQL connection details

    - Ensure user has proper permissions to view tables
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection Issues" icon="plug">
    **Problem**: MCP server won't start

    **Solution**:

    - Verify Node.js version (18.0.0\+)
