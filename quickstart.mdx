---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18.0.0+** installed on your system
- **Active Supabase project** with database access
- **MCP-compatible AI assistant** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Step 1: Get Your Tablr API Key

1. Visit the [Tablr Dashboard](https://tablr.vercel.app/dashboard/api-keys)
2. Sign in with your account
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Copy your API key (starts with `tb_`)

<Note>
Your API key is used for usage tracking and billing. Keep it secure and don't share it publicly.
</Note>

## Step 2: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Settings > API**
4. Copy your:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
   - **Service Role Key** (not the anon key)

<Warning>
Use the service role key, not the anon key. The service role key has full database access needed for Tablr operations.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Install Tablr MCP

Install the Tablr MCP server globally:

```bash
npm install -g tablr-mcp
```

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```env
TABLR_API_KEY=tb_your_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Step 5: Configure Your AI Assistant

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop/Cursor/Windsurf/VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tablr": {
      "command": "tablr-mcp",
      "args": ["absolute/path/to/your/.env"]
    }
  }
}
```
Note: do not use backslashes for windows file paths

## Step 6: Start Using Tablr

Restart your AI assistant and start managing your database with natural language:

### Basic Commands

```
"Show me all tables in my database"
"What's the schema for the users table?"
"Create a new table called 'posts' with title and content columns"
"Find all users created in the last week"
"Insert a new user with email john@example.com"
```

### Advanced Operations

```
"Add an index on the email column for better performance"
"Update all inactive users to set their status to archived"
"Execute this SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'"
"Create a backup of the important_data table"
```

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. **Test Connection**: Ask your AI assistant "List all tables"
2. **Check API Key**: Verify usage appears in your Tablr dashboard
3. **Test Operations**: Try creating a simple table or querying existing data

## Common Issues
