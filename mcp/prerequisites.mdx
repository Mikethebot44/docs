## Overview

Before setting up Tablr MCP, ensure you have all the required software, accounts, and access credentials. This guide will walk you through each requirement and how to verify your setup.

<Note>
Taking time to verify these prerequisites will save you troubleshooting time later. Each requirement serves a specific purpose in the Tablr MCP ecosystem.
</Note>

## Required Software

### Node.js (Version 18.0.0 or Higher)

Node.js is the JavaScript runtime that powers Tablr MCP. Version 18+ is required for modern JavaScript features and security updates.

**Installation:**
- Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
- Follow the installer instructions for your operating system

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
node --version

# Expected output: v18.x.x or higher
```

<Tip>
If you have an older version of Node.js, consider using a version manager like `nvm` (macOS/Linux) or `nvm-windows` to manage multiple Node.js versions.
</Tip>

### npm (Node Package Manager)

npm comes bundled with Node.js and is used to install Tablr MCP's dependencies.

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check npm version
npm --version

# Expected output: 8.x.x or higher
```

### Git (Version Control)

Git is needed to clone the Tablr MCP repository and manage code updates.

**Installation:**
- Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- Follow the installation guide for your operating system

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check Git installation
git --version

# Expected output: git version 2.x.x
```

## Required Accounts

### Supabase Account

Supabase provides the PostgreSQL database that Tablr MCP manages. A free account includes:
- 2 projects
- 500MB database storage
- 50,000 monthly active users
- 2GB bandwidth

**Setup Steps:**
1. Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Sign up with GitHub, Google, or email
4. Verify your email address

### Supabase Project

You need an active Supabase project with a database to manage.

**Creating a Project:**
1. Log into your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose an organization (or create one)
4. Enter project details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive project name
   - **Database Password**: Strong, secure password
   - **Region**: Choose closest to your location
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait for project initialization (2-3 minutes)

<Note>
Remember your database password - you'll need it for direct database access, though Tablr MCP uses service keys for authentication.
</Note>

## System Verification

Run these commands to verify your environment is ready:

### Complete Prerequisites Check

```bash
# Create a new directory for testing
mkdir tablr-mcp-test && cd tablr-mcp-test

# Check all required software
echo "Node.js version:"
node --version

echo "npm version:"
npm --version

echo "Git version:"
git --version

# Test npm functionality
npm init -y
npm install dotenv
echo "npm is working correctly"

# Clean up
cd .. && rm -rf tablr-mcp-test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Node.js version:
v18.17.0

npm version:
9.6.7

Git version:
git version 2.40.1

npm is working correctly
```

## Supabase Setup Verification

### Access Your Project Credentials

1. **Navigate to Project Settings:**
   - Open your Supabase dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**

2. **Locate Required Information:**
   - **Project URL**: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`
   - **Service Role Key**: Long key starting with `eyJ`

<Warning>
**Security Important**: The service_role key has admin privileges. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly. It's more powerful than the anon/public key.
</Warning>

### Test Database Connection

Verify your Supabase project is accessible:

1. **Using Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to **Table Editor** in your project
   - You should see the interface without errors
   - Try creating a test table to verify write access

2. **Using SQL Editor:**
   - Go to **SQL Editor** in your project
   - Run a simple query: `SELECT NOW();`
   - You should see the current timestamp

### Understand Key Differences

| Key Type | Purpose | Power Level | Use Case |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| `anon` | Public access | Limited | Frontend applications |
| `service_role` | Server access | Full admin | Backend services (Tablr MCP) |

<Tip>
Tablr MCP requires the `service_role` key because it needs to perform administrative database operations like creating tables and managing schemas.
</Tip>

## Optional but Recommended

### Code Editor

While not required, a good code editor improves the development experience:

**Recommended Options:**
- **Visual Studio Code** - Free, extensive extension ecosystem
- **Cursor** - AI-powered editor with built-in MCP support
- **WebStorm** - Full-featured IDE for JavaScript/TypeScript

### MCP Client for Testing

Having an MCP client ready helps with testing:

**Popular Options:**
- **Claude Desktop** - Desktop AI assistant by Anthropic
- **MCP Inspector** - Web-based testing tool
- **Cursor IDE** - Code editor with MCP integration

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Node.js Version Issues

**Problem**: `node --version` shows version < 18
```bash
# Solution: Update Node.js
# Download latest LTS from nodejs.org
# Or use version manager:
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

### npm Permission Errors

**Problem**: `npm install` fails with permission errors
```bash
# Solution: Fix npm permissions
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

### Git Not Found

**Problem**: `git --version` command not found
```bash
# Solution: Install Git
# macOS: brew install git
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install git
# Windows: Download from git-scm.com
```

### Supabase Connection Issues

**Problem**: Can't access Supabase dashboard or project

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify account email is confirmed
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
5. Contact Supabase support if issues persist

## Ready to Proceed?

Once you've verified all prerequisites:

**Node.js 18+** installed and working  
**npm** functioning correctly  
**Git** available for repository operations  
**Supabase account** created and verified
