# Claude Desktop Integration

Claude Desktop is Anthropic's desktop application that supports MCP servers, allowing you to interact with your Supabase database through natural language conversations.

## Overview

With Claude Desktop integration, you can:
- Ask questions about your database structure in natural language
- Query data using conversational commands
- Create and modify tables through AI assistance
- Execute complex database operations safely

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, ensure you have:
- **Tablr MCP server** properly installed and configured
- **Claude Desktop application** installed on your system
- **Valid Supabase credentials** configured in your environment

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install Claude Desktop

Download and install Claude Desktop from the official website:
- Visit [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)
- Download the version for your operating system
- Install and create an account if you don't have one

### Step 2: Locate Configuration File

Find the Claude Desktop configuration file for your platform:

<CodeGroup>

```bash macOS
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

```bash Windows
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

```bash Linux
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Configure Tablr MCP Server

Create or edit the configuration file with your Tablr MCP setup:

```json claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tablr-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/tablr-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project-id.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "your-service-role-key",
        "SUPABASE_PROJECT_NAME": "your-project-name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
**Important Configuration Notes:**
- Use the **absolute path** to your `dist/index.js` file
- Include your environment variables in the `env` section  
- Make sure the path doesn't contain spaces or special characters
- Restart Claude Desktop after making changes
</Warning>

### Step 4: Verify Connection

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** completely
2. **Start a new conversation** 
3. **Test the connection** by typing: "What database tools do you have available?"
4. Claude should list all Tablr MCP tools available

</Steps>

## Platform-Specific Setup

### macOS Setup

```bash
# Navigate to configuration directory
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/

# Create config file if it doesn't exist
touch claude_desktop_config.json

# Edit with your preferred editor
nano claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Windows Setup

```cmd
# Navigate to configuration directory  
cd %APPDATA%\Claude

# Create config file if it doesn't exist
type nul > claude_desktop_config.json

# Edit with notepad
notepad claude_desktop_config.json
```

### Linux Setup

```bash
# Create configuration directory if needed
mkdir -p ~/.config/Claude

# Create and edit config file
nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

## Usage Examples

Once integrated, you can interact with your database using natural language:

### Basic Queries

```
You: "Show me all tables in my database"
Claude: [Uses list_tables tool and displays results]

You: "Get the schema for the users table"  
Claude: [Uses get_table_schema tool and shows column details]

You: "Find all users created in the last week"
Claude: [Uses query_records with date filters]
```

### Data Operations

```
You: "Add a new user with email 'john@example.com'"
Claude: [Uses insert_records to add the user]

You: "Update all inactive users to active status"
Claude: [Uses update_records with appropriate filters]

You: "Delete test users from the database"
Claude: [Uses delete_records with confirmation]
```

### Schema Management

```
You: "Create a new table for storing blog posts"
Claude: [Uses create_table with appropriate schema]

You: "Add an 'avatar_url' column to the users table"
Claude: [Uses alter_table to modify the schema]

You: "Drop the temporary_data table"
Claude: [Uses drop_table with confirmation prompts]
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Database Projects

You can configure multiple Tablr MCP instances for different projects:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tablr-production": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tablr-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://prod-project.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "prod-service-key",
        "SUPABASE_PROJECT_NAME": "Production Database"
      }
    },
    "tablr-staging": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/path/to/tablr-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://staging-project.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "staging-service-key",
        "SUPABASE_PROJECT_NAME": "Staging Database"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variable Management

For better security, you can reference environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tablr-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tablr-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "${SUPABASE_URL}",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "${SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}",
        "SUPABASE_PROJECT_NAME": "${SUPABASE_PROJECT_NAME}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Claude doesn't recognize database tools">
**Solutions:**
- Verify you're using **absolute paths** in the configuration
- Check that the configuration file is in the correct location for your OS
- Restart Claude Desktop completely after making changes
- Ensure the `dist/index.js` file exists (run `npm run build`)
- Check Claude Desktop logs for error messages
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configuration file not found">
**Solutions:**
- Create the directory structure manually if it doesn't exist
- Verify the path matches your operating system
- Check file permissions and ensure you can write to the directory
- Try creating the file manually first
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Environment variables not loading">
**Solutions:**
- Include environment variables directly in the `env` section
- Verify your `.env` file is properly formatted
- Check that Supabase credentials are correct
- Test the server independently with `npm start`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server connection failures">
**Solutions:**
- Ensure Node.js is properly installed and accessible
- Verify the path to `dist/index.js` is correct
- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Test with MCP Inspector first: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js`
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tablr-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/tablr-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "your-key",
        "DEBUG": "true",
        "MCP_DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Validation Steps

To ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Test server independently**: `npm start` in the Tablr MCP directory
2. **Verify build artifacts**: Check that `dist/` directory contains compiled files
3. **Test with MCP Inspector**: Use the inspector tool before Claude Desktop
4. **Check logs**: Look for error messages in Claude Desktop's console
5. **Start simple**: Begin with basic queries like "list tables"

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

- **Never commit** configuration files with credentials to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive information when possible
- **Limit database access** using Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Monitor database operations** performed through Claude Desktop

### Performance Tips

- **Use specific queries** rather than broad table scans
- **Limit result sets** when working with large tables
- **Cache frequently accessed schema information**
- **Test complex operations** with MCP Inspector first

### Workflow Optimization

- **Start conversations** with database discovery: "What tables are available?"
- **Ask for schema** before modifying tables: "Show me the users table structure"
- **Use confirmations** for destructive operations
- **Save complex queries** as documentation for reuse

## Next Steps

Once you have Claude Desktop working with Tablr MCP:

1. **Explore all available tools** by asking Claude to list them
2. **Practice with safe operations** like querying and schema inspection
3. **Set up multiple environments** for development, staging, and production
4. **Create workflows** for common database management tasks
5. **Integrate with your development process** for efficient database operations
