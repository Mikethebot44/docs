## Next Steps

After installation, you'll need to:

1. **[Configure credentials](/mcp/configuration)** - Set up your Supabase and Tablr API keys
2. **[Integrate with AI assistant](/mcp/integration/claude-desktop)** - Connect to Claude Desktop or other MCP clients
3. **[Test the setup](/mcp/integration/testing)** - Verify everything works correctly

<Tip>
The installation process only sets up the Tablr MCP server. You'll need to configure your credentials before you can manage databases.
