## What is Tablr MCP?

Tablr MCP is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive database management for PostgreSQL databases. It allows AI assistants to:

- **Explore** your database structure (tables, schemas, relationships)
- **Query** data with complex filters and sorting
- **Modify** table structures and data
- **Execute** custom SQL safely
- **Manage** database operations through natural language

Instead of manually writing SQL or using database administration tools, you can simply ask your AI assistant: *"Show me all users created this week"* or *"Create a new table for storing blog posts"*.

## Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants and applications to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge between AI models and your databases, APIs, or other services.

### Key MCP Concepts

**MCP Server** - A service that provides tools and data to AI clients. **Tablr MCP is an MCP server** that exposes database management capabilities to AI assistants.

**MCP Client** - An application that uses MCP servers to extend its capabilities. Examples include Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and custom applications.

**Tools** - Functions that the server exposes for the client to use. Tablr MCP provides comprehensive database management tools like `list_tables`, `query_records`, and `create_table`.

**Transport** - How the client and server communicate via stdio, HTTP, or WebSocket protocols.

### Why Use MCP?

- **Standardized Interface** - Works with any MCP-compatible AI assistant
- **Secure Access** - Controlled access to your data with proper authentication
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new capabilities as your needs grow
- **Interoperable** - One server can work with multiple AI clients simultaneously

### How MCP Works

1. **Connection Establishment** - The AI client connects to the MCP server
2. **Capability Discovery** - The client discovers available tools and resources
3. **Tool Execution** - When you ask the AI to perform a database operation, the client calls the appropriate tool
4. **Response Handling** - The server processes requests, interacts with your database, and returns formatted results

## Quick Start

Ready to dive in? Here's what you need:

1. **Node.js 18+** and **npm** installed
2. **PostgreSQL database** with connection access
3. **Database credentials** with appropriate permissions

<Note>
Tablr MCP provides comprehensive database management functions that work with any MCP-compatible AI assistant, including Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and custom applications.
</Note>

## Example Usage

Once set up, you can interact with your database through natural language:

```
You: "Show me all tables in my database"
AI: [Uses list_tables tool and shows results]

You: "Get the schema for the users table"
AI: [Uses get_table_schema tool]

You: "Find all users created in the last week"
AI: [Uses query_records with date filters]

You: "Create a new table for storing blog posts"
AI: [Uses create_table with appropriate schema]
```

## Architecture Overview

Tablr MCP acts as a bridge between AI assistants and your PostgreSQL database:

- **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) sends requests
- **Tablr MCP Server** processes requests and validates operations
- **PostgreSQL Database** executes the actual database operations
- **Results** are formatted and returned to the AI assistant
