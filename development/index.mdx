## Development Philosophy

Tablr MCP is built with the following principles in mind:

### Type Safety First
- **Full TypeScript support** with strict typing
- **Comprehensive type definitions** for all interfaces
- **Runtime validation** of inputs and outputs

### Modular Architecture
- **Tool-based design** where each function is a separate tool
- **Shared base classes** for common functionality
- **Clean separation** between core infrastructure and tool implementations

### Security by Design
- **Input validation** at every layer
- **SQL injection protection** through parameterized queries
- **Confirmation prompts** for destructive operations

### Developer Experience
- **Clear error messages** with actionable suggestions
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging
- **Hot reload** during development
- **Extensive documentation** and examples

## Core Components

### Base Tool Class
All tools inherit from `BaseTool` which provides:
- Response formatting
- Error handling
- Connection management
- Validation helpers

### Tool Registry
Manages tool registration and discovery:
- Automatic tool loading
- Schema validation
- Runtime tool access

### Connection Manager
Handles Supabase connections:
- Connection pooling
- Authentication
- Health checking
- Error recovery

### Response Formatter
Standardizes all tool responses:
- Success/error formatting
- Performance metrics
- Message consistency

## Development Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure your development environment
2. **Code Changes**: Make your modifications following established patterns
3. **Testing**: Test with MCP Inspector and Claude Desktop
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed
5. **Contribution**: Submit pull requests following our guidelines

## Getting Started

Ready to start developing? Begin with the [Development Setup](/mcp/development/setup) guide to configure your environment and understand the project structure.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js 18+, TypeScript knowledge, and familiarity with the MCP protocol before beginning development.
